# 🌐 Edwin Julian — Front-End Developer

Hi, I’m **Edwin Julian**, a Front-End Developer from Indonesia with **4+ years of experience** building clean, fast, and maintainable web interfaces using **D3.js**, **React**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript**. I’m especially interested in **data visualization** and applying **functional programming** principles to create predictable, composable, and scalable UI.

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio, where I showcase selected projects and my approach to performance, accessibility, and modern front-end architecture for production-ready applications.

I currently work full-time and continue to grow through side projects, deepening my skills in UI/UX, web performance, testing, and data-driven interfaces. I’m looking to contribute to a remote, product-focused team where I can collaborate with designers and engineers to build high-quality user experiences.
