# 🌐 Edwin Julian — Front-End Developer

Hi, I’m Edwin Julian, a **Front-End Developer**. I’ve spent over **4 years building websites** that are fast, easy to use, and enjoyable for people to interact with. I love working with **React**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript**, and I’m passionate about **data visualization** and creating interfaces that are **clear, reliable, and easy to maintain**.

This repository is my **personal portfolio**, where I share some of my favorite projects and show how I think about **performance, accessibility, and building modern web applications**.

I currently work full-time but always make time for side projects to explore new ideas and improve my skills in **UI/UX, web performance, testing, and creating data-driven interfaces**. I’m excited to join a **remote, product-focused team** where I can collaborate with designers and engineers to create **great user experiences**.
