# Edwin Julian

I’m a **Front-End Engineer** with **5+ years of experience** building web applications using **React, Next.js, TypeScript, and D3.js**, with a particular interest in **functional programming** and **data visualization**.

This portfolio includes a selection of projects that reflect how I think about **performance**, **accessibility**, and building **maintainable user interfaces**.

I currently work full-time and spend some of my free time on side projects, mainly to explore topics like **UI/UX**, **web performance**, **testing**, and **data-driven interfaces**. I’m used to working with **remote, distributed teams** and collaborating with **designers and engineers** across different time zones.
